        <li>
          Heat oven to 425 degrees. In a 9-by-13-inch baking dish, toss the
          potato wedges with 3 tablespoons olive oil and 1/2 teaspoon oregano.
          Season with salt and pepper. Spread the potatoes out in an even layer.
          (It’s OK if some overlap). Bake, tossing gently once halfway through
          cooking, until the edges begin to brown, and the potatoes can be
          pierced with a fork but are still quite firm, about 30 minutes.
          (They’ll finish cooking with the chicken.)
        </li>
        <li>
          While potatoes roast, prepare the chicken: Season the chicken with
          salt, pepper and the remaining 1 teaspoon oregano. In a large 12-inch
          skillet, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high
          until it shimmers. Working in batches if necessary, cook the chicken,
          skin-side down, until it is golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer
          the chicken to a plate.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reduce heat to medium-low, add the butter and garlic to the skillet
          and cook until the butter is melted and the garlic is fragrant and
          just beginning to brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the chicken stock and
          wine to the skillet, bring to a simmer and cook for 2 minutes. Add the
          peas. Pour the mixture evenly over the potatoes, then gently stir to
          combine. Place chicken on top of the cooked potato mixture, skin-side
          up. Drizzle any reserved chicken juices on top.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake until the chicken is cooked through and the potatoes are tender,
          20 to 25 minutes. Turn on the oven’s broiler function, and broil until
          the chicken skin is golden brown and crisp, 1 to 2 minutes. Drizzle
          with lemon juice, and sprinkle with parsley. Serve immediately, with
          plenty of the pan juices spooned over the chicken and potatoes, and
          crusty bread on the side.

        <li>
          Heat oven to 400. Season the chicken aggressively with salt and

          oven-safe sauté pan or Dutch oven set over high flame, until the
          butter is foaming. Sear the chicken in batches, skin-side down, until
          it is golden and crisp, approximately 5 to 7 minutes. Then turn the
          chicken over, and repeat on the other side, approximately 5 to 7
          minutes. Remove chicken to a plate to rest.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour off all but a tablespoon or 2 of the accumulated fat in the pot.
          Return the pot to the stove, over medium heat, and add the onion.
          Cook, stirring frequently with a spoon to scrape off any browned bits
          of chicken skin, until the onion has softened and gone translucent,
          approximately 5 minutes. Add the garlic, and stir again, cooking it
          until it has softened, approximately 3 to 4 minutes. Add the paprika
          and the flour, and stir well to combine, then cook until the mixture
          is fragrant and the taste of the flour has been cooked out,
          approximately 4 to 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add tomatoes and broth, whisk until smooth and then nestle the chicken
          back in the pan, skin-side up. Slide the pan or pot into the oven, and
          cook until the chicken has cooked through and the sauce has thickened
          slightly, approximately 25 to 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile, set a large pot of heavily salted water to boil over high
          heat. Cook noodles in the water until they are almost completely
          tender, approximately 7 to 8 minutes. Drain the noodles, and toss them
          in a bowl with the remaining butter, then toss again to coat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place the chicken on top of the noodles, then add the sour cream to
          the sauce, stir to combine and ladle it over the whole.

          Make the chicken: Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place the
          eggs, panko and flour in 3 separate shallow bowls. Season the flour
          with cayenne, and whisk. Season the chicken generously with salt and
          pepper. Heat a thin layer of oil (about 1/8 inch) in your largest
          skillet.

          As oil heats, dip the chicken breasts, one at a time, into the flour.

          Shake off the excess and dip into the bread crumbs, gently pressing

          the pan again, cooking until both sides are golden brown, about 3
          minutes more. When the chicken is golden brown and just cooked

          mushrooms are just tender, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and
          pepper. Stir in the wine and bring to a boil. Cook, stirring, for a
          few minutes, until the wine has reduced by about half. Add the
          tomatoes and salt and pepper to taste. Cook over medium heat for 5 to
          10 minutes, stirring often, until the tomatoes have cooked down a
          little and smell fragrant. Stir in the mushroom soaking liquid that
          you set aside.

          Return the chicken pieces to the pan and stir so that they are well
          submerged in the tomato mixture. Cover and simmer over medium heat for
          30 minutes, until the chicken is tender. Taste, adjust seasoning and
          serve with pasta or rice.
